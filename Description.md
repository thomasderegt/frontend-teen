Wheel of Islam. Insight. Spirituality. Growth.

Wheel of Islam is an Islamic spiritual health app that guides Muslims in their spiritual and personal development. 
It is rooted in Islamic spiritual tradition on books like manazil as saireen and built to fit the digital world people live in today. 

The app is structured around three core pillars:

Insight —Islamic thought, ethics 
Spirituality — Actions and purification of the heart, getting closer to Allah 
Growth — fostering positive behaviour, and character development 

Using a mobile-first design and an interactive Wheels Model — with God (Allah) at the center of every wheel.
the app combines visual clarity with spiritual depth.
